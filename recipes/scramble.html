      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is both simple and delicious. It only requires a handful of ingredients and can be scaled
           feed one person, two people, or an entire family! It is a recipe that will not fail. I mean, who <em>doesn't</em>
           like scrambled eggs?</p>
        <p>Before we get started, you'll want to grab a non-stick skillet (I prefer non-stick for easy cleanup)
           and gather all of your ingredients. This recipe will yield two servings, but as I mentioned earlier, can
           be scaled to feed as many people as you wish! So, without further ado, let's begin!</p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>4 eggs</li>
              <li>1 sausage link (I typically use Aidell's pre-cooked chicken sausage)</li>
              <li>1 small yellow onion</li>
              <li>1 small green pepper</li>
              <li>4oz white mushrooms</li>
              <li>1tbsp butter</li>
            </ul>
              <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Chop all of your veggies and sausage into small, evenly sized cubes</li>
                  <li>In your non-stick skillet, heat 1tbsp butter over medium heat</li>
                  <li>Once hot, add sausage, onions, peppers and mushrooms - Cook for about 10 minutes</li>
                  <li>While the veggies and sausage cook, crack 4 eggs into a medium sized bowl</li>
                  <li>Whisk eggs together until mixed well</li>
                  <li>Pour the eggs into the skillet with the rest of ingredients</li>
                  <li>Stir occasionally, making sure the eggs cook thoroughly</li>
                  <li>Remove from heat and serve!</li>
