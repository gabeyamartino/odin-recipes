      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is both simple and delicious. It only requires a handful of ingredients and can be scaled
           feed one person, two people, or an entire family! It is a recipe that will not fail. I mean, who <em>doesn't</em>
           like scrambled eggs?</p>
        <p>Before we get started, you'll want to grab a non-stick skillet (I prefer non-stick for easy cleanup)
           and gather all of your ingredients. This recipe will yield two servings, but as I mentioned earlier, can
           be scaled to feed as many people as you wish! So, without further ado, let's begin!</p>
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>4 eggs</li>
              <li>1 sausage link (I typically use Aidell's pre-cooked chicken sausage)</li>
              <li></li>
            </ul>
