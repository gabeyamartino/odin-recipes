      <h2>Descripton</h2>
        <p>This is a super easy dish that only requires a few ingredients and comes out super tasty!
           You will essentially just add all of the ingredients into a slow cooker, set it for 2 hours
           on high (or 4 hours on low) and enjoy when it is done!</p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>3lbs chicken (Thighs work best for this one)</li>
              <li>1 cup water</li>
              <li>1/2 cup white vinegar</li>
              <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
              <li>Bay leaves</li>
              <li>Garlic (as much as you'd like)</li>
              <li>Crushed red pepper</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Combine all ingredients in your crockpot or slow cooker</li>
              <li>Set your crockpot to the low setting</li>
              <li>Cover and cook for 4 hours, stirring occasionally (Note, you can also cook for 2.5 on high)</li>
              <li>Serve with your favorite side dishes (I usually have it with white rice and steamed brocolli)</li>
            </ol>
